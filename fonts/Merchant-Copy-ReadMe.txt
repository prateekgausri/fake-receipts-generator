A TrueType Font family by S. John Ross

"Merchant Copy" is a family of three fonts (Merchant Copy, Merchant Copy Wide, and Merchant Copy Doublesize), mimicking dot-matrix print of the kind you'd get on a modern receipt. I built it from high-res scans of printout samples, and scaled it to match the original as closely as possible. If you set the type to exactly 12 points ... it won't be 12 points, but it will be the same scale as a real receipt (the "Doublesize" variant isn't just the regular font at twice the scale, either, it's a completely different font with an appropriately-scaled level of detail). The fonts are all fixed-width, and include full U.S. keyboard sets (along with duplicate glyphs for things like smart-quotes, which I recommend using since the regular quotes are curled in one direction, to match the source).
